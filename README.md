Simple HTTPS server was developed to simplify development for secure sites. It aims to provide a simple mechanism to proxy APIs and a static app under the same domain on a developers workstation. Thereby eliminating the need for CORS exceptions and encouraging the use of best practises like HTTPS only cookies.

## Dependencies

- self-signed certificate.
- static site.
- IP based applications (virtual-host mappings currently not supported).
- Golang >= 1.4.2.
